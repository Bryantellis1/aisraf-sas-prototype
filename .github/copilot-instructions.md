# Copilot Instructions For AISRAF SAS Prototype v0.1.2

This workspace is the clean rebuild root for **AISRAF SAS Prototype v0.1.2**. Confirm the workspace root is `D:/E-Way 2/AISRAF- SAS Prototype v0.1.2` before reading or writing package artifacts.

## Package Boundary

- The old package at `D:/E-Way 2/aisraf-sas-prototype-skill-chain-pack-v0.01` is read-only reference material.
- Do not modify the old package.
- Do not copy old generated outputs, stale release artifacts, failed diagrams, run proof, or temporary reports into this workspace.
- Use [PACKAGE-MANIFEST.yaml](../PACKAGE-MANIFEST.yaml), [FOLDER-CONTRACTS.md](../FOLDER-CONTRACTS.md), and [BUILD-ORDER.md](../BUILD-ORDER.md) as the current source of Build Package, Root Area, and filesystem structure truth.

## Current State

Build Packages 01–06 are active. Build Package 06 added 8 canonical Prototype Review Agent (PRA) specifications under `prototype-agents/`, the prototype-agent registry (`prototype-agents/prototype-agent-registry.yaml`), the PRA authoring template, and 7 thin local `.agent.md` adapter wrappers under `.agents/` (orchestrator, input-reader, dfd-extractor, review-table-builder, blueprint-questioner, finding-recommender, handoff-qa-scorer). Each adapter is a thin wrapper that points to canonical PRA, prompt, and skill paths and uses only the seven authoritative run-profile variables. PRA-04-LEGEND-NORMALIZER has no dedicated adapter; it is wrapped jointly with PRA-03 by `.agents/aisraf-dfd-extractor.agent.md`. PRAs are specifications, not deployed runtime agents; adapters are local Copilot dropdown entries, not deployed runtime agents. Later Build Packages must follow their own build contracts before adding catalogs, blueprints, templates beyond authoring-agent templates, samples, runs, diagrams, documentation, release packaging, or final QA artifacts. The next allowed Build Package is Build Package 07 — Catalogs.

## Foundation Rules

- Keep work inside the active workspace unless an instruction explicitly says to read the old reference package.
- Prefer editing existing Build Package 01 files over creating new files.
- Create only files authorized by the current Build Package contract.
- Do not create unlisted root files or folders.
- Use “Build Package” for the 01-16 implementation sequence.
- Use “Root Area” for package-tree and folder diagram numbering.
- Use the exact lowercase filesystem folder names listed in [FOLDER-CONTRACTS.md](../FOLDER-CONTRACTS.md).
- Do not create diagrams before Build Package 13.
- Do not create run outputs before Build Package 11.
- Do not create release DOCX/PDF/PPTX/ZIP artifacts before Build Package 15.
- Do not claim final QA, seal, or export before Build Package 16.

## Artifact Boundaries

- Prompt: reusable instruction file for Copilot or an agent, active in Build Package 04 (`prompts/prompt-registry.yaml`, `prompts/rs/*.prompt.md`, `prompts/dfd/*.prompt.md`).
- Skill: reusable work contract, not an executable tool, active in Build Package 05 (`skills/skill-registry.yaml`, `skills/rs/SK-*.md`, `skills/dfd/SK-DFD-0[1-9]-*.md`).
- PRA: Prototype Review Agent specification, not a deployed runtime agent, active in Build Package 06 (`prototype-agents/prototype-agent-registry.yaml`, 8 `prototype-agents/PRA-0[1-8]-*.md` files, `prototype-agents/prototype-agent-template.md`).
- `.agent.md` adapter: local VS Code/GitHub Copilot thin wrapper around canonical PRA/prompt/skill artifacts, active in Build Package 06 (7 `.agents/aisraf-*.agent.md` files; PRA-04 has no dedicated adapter and is wrapped jointly by `.agents/aisraf-dfd-extractor.agent.md`).
- Catalog: controlled vocabulary source, deferred to Build Package 07.
- Blueprint: reusable review pattern, deferred to Build Package 08.
- Template: reusable output shape, deferred to Build Package 09 except Build Package 01 authoring-agent templates.
- Run: self-contained execution evidence folder, deferred to Build Package 11.
- Validation: evidence-bound checks and gates, expanded in Build Package 12.
- Release: generated reader artifacts only, deferred to Build Package 15.

## Evidence And Claims

Do not claim tests, external post-back, live Copilot adapter execution, cloud runtime, MCP execution, ADK execution, Vertex/GCP execution, Jira/Confluence/Rovo execution, database execution, Terraform execution, release packaging, diagram generation, or final QA unless the correct package authorizes the action and evidence exists in the governed location. Build Package 06 PRA specs and `.agent.md` adapters are local-only specifications and wrappers; selecting an adapter from the Copilot Chat dropdown is not equivalent to runtime execution.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report the issue before writing if a requested change would create a prohibited artifact, write outside the allowed package surfaces, modify the old reference workspace, introduce secrets, or claim functionality that has not been implemented by the proper package.
